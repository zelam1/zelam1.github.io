**Welcome to Oswald's Flying Adventures! Help Oswald the Flying Pig navigate the sky and collect cotton candy.  Avoid pesky thunderstorm clouds because every time he hits one, he moves faster.  
The player has 30 seconds to collect as much cotton candy as possible.  Oswald moves up and down via a joystick connected to an Arduino. He is set to a costant speed. Every time he hits a piece of cotton candy, a buzzer goes off.  The music will speed up during the last 10 seconds of the game.**

**Future Developments:**
In the future, I would like to implement a pause function that stops the game whenever a thundercloud it hit.  The game would then start back up at a faster speed than before.  I feel like this would give the game an overall better look.  I would also add more obstacles in the sky that Oswald would have to avoid, like flying garbage that stops his movements.
